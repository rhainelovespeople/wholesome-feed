API KEYS:
In order to use the scraping script, you need to create a file called "api_keys.json" and put your API keys in this format:

{
    "API_key": "",
    "API_secret_key": "",
    "access_token": "",
    "access_token_secret": ""
}
Alternatively, you can comment out the file reading part and just copy and paste your keys into auth directly.
